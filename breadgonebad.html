    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In collaboration with my project group, we made the decision to establish our own hypothetical game studio named Studio 21. Our aim was to develop a tower defence game with a bakery theme, allowing players to actively participate in combat against enemies. This game is titled "Bread-Gone-Bad-TD."</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
      The anti-littering campaign aims to encourage proper disposal of cigarette butts. It utilizes 
      innovative designs like portable ashtrays and interactive bins that reward users for responsible 
      behavior. These ideas were deployed in parks and city squares to make a visible difference.
